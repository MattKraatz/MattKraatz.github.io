title: Reflections on Nashville Software School
---

Well, my time as a student with Nashville Software School has come to a close, and wow did those six months fly by. When every day is spent learning, expanding and applying new concepts, it's easy to lose track of time. NSS didn't just teach me the craft of software development, or how to learn continuously, or how to work in a development team; most importantly it exposed my passion for coding and reinforced my decision to pivot careers.

Looking back, I'm very pleased with how I took advantage of the opportunities presented at NSS. Before I even started the program, I made sure I could devote my full attention and enthusiasm towards consuming the curriculum. Being a quick learner, at times I found the pace to be a little slow (for me), and so I picked up side projects and code challenges to continue learning and applying my understanding at full speed. At NSS I truly lived the "you get out of it what you put in" philosophy, and acclimated quickly towards finding solutions to my own problems. Ultimately, that's the real world, maybe you'll be able to bounce an idea off of your development team, but just as often you can't. After coming through NSS, I feel very prepared to tackle any new challenge that comes my way, especially after having a strong foundation in OOP principles.

That being said, there's enormous value in hearing another developer's perspective on any challenge. Most problems in development have multiple solutions, which is both encouraging and daunting. Which solution is the "best" solution? What makes it the "best" solution? Performance, readability, scalability, testability, all of the above? Being able to talk those challenges out with other developers not only reveals solutions you hadn't thought of, but also builds experience and wisdom that will follow you through the rest of your career.

I am so excited to have these new skills on my toolbelt. I've always liked to build things, and generally be productive, and now I can do that with just my brain, a little patience, and a development environment. I've built things in my spare time that were fun to code and that I actually use in my daily life, all while getting more comfortable with software development and adding new technologies to my portfolio. It's so refreshing to be excited about getting to work, and to have trouble sometimes pulling myself away from my workstation (because everyone needs sleep every once in a while).

Over the last six months, in addition to becoming a software developer, I've become a cheerleader for NSS. If you are looking into NSS, or have friends and family that are curious about software development, I'd love to be a resource for you.

Happy coding!
