title: Technologies I've learned
---

As I've started to develop my professional story to most effectively look for employment over the next few months, I've uncovered a need to catalogue the technologies I've learned and used in practice since my journey began this year. This is meant to be fairly comprehensive of specific technologies I am comfortable working with, but more important is an understanding of the underlying software development principles that I've gained in the process. I expect updates to this list periodically over time, but to start, in no particular order:

#### Workflow
* git
* GitHub

#### Languages
* Javascript
* C#
* HTML
* CSS

#### Frameworks
* AngularJS
* .NET
* TurnJS
* JQuery
* ASP.NET Core MVC and Web API
* Entity Framework/Linq
* Ionic
* Jekyll

#### Styling
* Sass
* Bootstrap
* Materialize

#### Other
* Handlebars
* Browserify
* Grunt
* NPM
* Bower
* Firebase
* Bash Scripting

#### Editors
