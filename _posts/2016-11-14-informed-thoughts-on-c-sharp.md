title: Informed Thoughts on c#
---

Coming into c# a blank slate, my expectations for the language were based solely on surface-level conversations with mentors and instructors, which usually carried a tone of ominous sobriety. As students relatively new to coding and just entering our second language, fear of the unknown was rampant. I had a sense that my transition into a statically-typed, newly open-sourced language would be difficult and frustrating, but hopefully achievable and ultimately rewarding.

Fear of the unknown is exactly that, uncertainty about not knowing what you don't know, and not knowing what it even is that you don't know. What I failed to recognize was everything that I already did know: object-oriented programming, inheritance, asynchronous http requests, MVC design patterns, and so much more. Those were all things I had to learn for the first time with JavaScript, and only need to translate into c# and .NET (although that translation can feel like Chinese at times).

After the first few weeks of culture shock from feeling my way around a c# program, I became comfortable with the syntax and started feeling like my pace of learning slowed. This was frustrating to me--but ultimately a false perception that took me weeks to overcome. Sure, my brain hurt a little more after an average day of JavaScript study a few months ago, but while I was learning JavaScript I was also learning those core programming principles detailed above. So instead of learning the core principle alongside the language and framework magic, I'm just learning the language and everything is coming a little more naturally. I surprised myself by how quickly I was able to pick up c#, and am ultimately far more confident in my ability to pick up any other new language.

Now, for some unordered thoughts:
* Statically-typed, compiled languages are a welcome relief from JavaScript. It's much easier to read and navigate, and I'm catching bugs from compilation warnings and errors rather than having to manually test my app in the browser.
* Speaking of tests, practicing test driven development with xUnit is a breeze and provides a great structure for planning and designing that was a bit harder to execute in JavaScript (or maybe it's just the repetition that's helping).
* Visual Studio is the best IDE I've ever used. The debugger is amazing and Intellisense has made me incredibly more productive while writing code.
* .NET (and especially .NET Core) is so vast and fragmented that the right documentation is a bit harder to come by. I'm pining for a documentation repository comparable to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) and so far have been left disappointed.
* This is a really exciting time for Microsoft. They're making themselves relevant again by open-sourcing .NET Core and focusing on the development community, and I'm excited to be a part of this new wave.

Overall, I'm really glad to have chosen this particular curriculum for my introduction to software development. JavaScript and c# are near polar opposites philosophically, so having an understanding of both ends will make it easier to consume anything inbetween (or beyond). Now I'm looking forward to my final capstone project to demonstrate my mastery of these concepts and to challenge myself even more.
